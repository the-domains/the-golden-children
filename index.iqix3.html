class="Paragraph " data-reactid="122"><p>Some days I want to sit and sulk. I want to feel sad and think unrationally for an entire night, wasting time while I could be sleeping peacefully. But I can’t, because I feel guilty for being sad, and I know it sounds dumb, or crazy, but I do. I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad, and they would tell me everything is going to be okay, and the truth is I know it will too. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to just let the sadness take me over and pour it all out sometimes. In all reality, I’ve known way too many children that have died to be okay. I’m twenty five years old and I can’t even count the number of children and friends I’ve known that have died on my fingers and toes. It sucks. And thinking about it makes me sick to m stomach, and it makes me want to break down and want to curl up in a ball and sulk. But I can’t. I can’t, because that doesn’t help anybody. That would get nothing accomplished and would benefit nobody but myself, which is why I’d feel guilty, and that’s even worse than feeling sad. I wish I could just pick up a phone an call you. Each and every one of you, and I can’t do that either, and that sucks too. And I even feel guilty for this rant, and I know I shouldn’t because this rant is spreading awareness too, but I do. But that’s life, and that’s the beauty of it. I feel, therefore I am alive. And that is a beautiful thing, and it’s something to be celebrated. Life should be a celebration, so here is to you and your loved ones. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="123"><p>Cheers,<br> Patrick</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column2x-f0955fcf-4a75-4bbd-9262-8ddb98a253b9" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="124"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="125"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1" data-reactid="126"><!-- react-empty: 127 --><!-- react-empty: 128 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="129"><h1 data-reactid="130"><span class="" data-reactid="131"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="132">Because I Knew You</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 133 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="134"><p>I’ve overcome everything I’ve undergone,<br> and I somehow found a way to pave the path that I’ve been on.<br> My story became your story, and now it’s ours<br> to share with the world so that you may never be unknown.<br> Adversity struck, and here we are<br> 7 years later<br> and I’m still trying o figure out what the hell happened.<br> Sometime tells me I’ll never know,<br> but I knew you<br> and that’s all that matters.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="135"><p>Love,<br> Patrick</p></div></div></div><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="136"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1" data-reactid="137"><!-- react-empty: 138 --><!-- react-empty: 139 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="140"><h1 data-reactid="141"><span class="" data-reactid="142"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="143">Tornadoes in California</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 144 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="145"><p>Quiet moments, the calm before the storm.<br> Like clockwork the tornado comes thrashing in.<br> No warnings, just the sudden memories being swept up into the whirlwind without hesitation.<br> There isn’t supposed to be tornadoes in California.<br> Only if the quiet continues does it continue to pick up speed, so distractions are searched for like a shelter;<br> an escape.<br> Most times there’s a hideaway near.<br> But other times,<br> the times when the storm seems everlasting,<br> the open field goes on for miles<br> with no hideaway in sight.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="146"><p>Love,<br> Patrick</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-LoadMoreWButton-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="147"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="148"><button class="color-box-pop pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="149"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-2rem h-2rem" data-reactid="150"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" enable-background="new 384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" xml:space="preserve"><path class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" d="M397.8,298c-7.4,0-13.4-6-13.4-13.4s6-13.4,13.4-13.4c5.3,0,10.2,3.2,12.3,8l-2.8,1.2  c-1.7-3.8-5.4-6.2-9.5-6.2c-5.7,0-10.4,4.7-10.4,10.4s4.7,10.4,10.4,10.4c4.6,0,8.7-3.1,10-7.5l2.9,0.8 C409.1,294,403.8,298,397.8,298z"/><polyline class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" points="410.9,274.4 410.9,281.2 404.1,281.2 "/><rect class="color-box-pop-text" x="396.6" y="280" fill="#F05525" width="2" height="9.2"/><rect x="393" y="283.6" class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" width="9.2" height="2"/></svg></span></button></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="151"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="152"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="153"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="154"><span data-reactid="155"><!-- react-empty: 156 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="157"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="158">The Golden Children</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="159"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="160"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="161"><div class="Link" data-reactid="162"><a data-reactid="163"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="164"><a data-reactid="165"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
