September is the official “Childhood Cancer Awareness Month,” although, I believe awareness should be important all year. It also happens to be the month that I was diagnosed with cancer almost 9 years ago. This year, September 18th, 2015 will mark 9 years since the day I was diagnosed with cancer and my life completely changed forever. Growing up, not once did I ever even consider that cancer could make a direct impact on my life. Like many people, I thought cancer only affected older people, as in it was one of the diseases you get at an old age and often times lead to death. I lost my grandpa to cancer when I was in elementary school, and I assumed it was part of life. Never in a million years did I ever think I would see all of the children and babies that I saw in the hospital after I was diagnosed. I saw children not even a year old, children that had never even seen a park yet, teenagers who hadn’t yet been to a dance, and the list goes on and on. After being diagnosed, the thoughts of all of the life experiences I might not ever get began to cross my mind rapidly. It wasn’t just for myself, though, it was of all the things I witnessed inside the hospital. Children had I.V. pole tricycles, they had only a couple hours a day to go into the play room, and the teenagers didn’t have much of anything. It saddened me to see how much deeper a cancer diagnosis impacted people than anyone might stop to think. It isn’t just about the chemo, the hair loss, and the drastic change in health, but also about the emotional and developmental impact it makes as well. Some kids lost their battles before ever having the chance to make a friend; think about that for a second. All of the life events that we think are normal, or we expect to happen, these are the things that so many of kids/teens affected by cancer never get a chance to experience. It’s unfathomable.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="34"><p data-reactid="35">This brings me to the very recent buzz that childhood cancer has picked up. Childhood Cancer has picked up full steam going into September and I couldn’t be happier. Many of you know, and if you haven’t you can google it, but Taylor Swift performed a song “Ronan” for the second time ever this past week and it took the world by storm. Childhood Cancer is in the mainstream media! That’s right, they’re focusing on something positive for a change! Mama Maya, Ronan’s mom, lost her son a couple years ago due to a Neuroblastoma diagnosis and she hasn’t strayed away from fighting cancer head on. She’s gone with her emotions and dedicated her life to fighting cancer, and it has impacted awareness, and celebrity support in a huge way. Now that we are booming in full speed going into September, a month where I also celebrate an anniversary, I want your support. I want you guys to share this, share a picture and tag me in it, anything, but share something that includes something gold that you will wear or share with somebody else in honor of myself and so many children that have survived, passed away, and are currently fighting this disease. During the month of September, I want you to wear something gold, even if it is something like makeup, or something silly, wear something gold, and share it with me and all of your followers/friends, and I will share it as well. I want Childhood Cancer to be trending as much as possible throughout the month of September and I cannot do that without your help. Who’s with me?? I know I have some amazing supporters, and I cannot stress enough how much I need each and every one of you. Please wear gold at least once during the month of September and let me see it when you do!</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="36"><p data-reactid="37">Love, Patrick</p></div></div></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="38"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title fx-2" data-reactid="40"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="41"><h1 data-reactid="42"><span class="" data-reactid="43"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="44">Permission Slips</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 45 --><!-- react-empty: 46 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text fx-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="48"><p data-reactid="49">There is no choice; no signature required or permission slip needed.

Once you go down that road, there’s no way back. This road has become a part of you now, it creates who you are. And you have a choice.

I enjoy sunsets and pictures of them. I do. I love going to the beach just to sit, and watch the waves as they never give up their endless conquest to make it onto shore; even though they never quite get high enough they keep going. I see clouds and wonder how they were formed, and hope one day I can see another one just like it. I prefer talking on the phone to text messaging, even if it means I can only do that one thing at a time. I love debates. Each time I get to learn something new, and get to know that person so much better. I don’t care about the crowd or what they’re doing. I consider myself an outsider, because that is where my passion lies. So, I like finding what others’ are too. I dig, deep, I want to see a persons soul rather than flesh. I’m not entertained by superficial conversations. Give me your passion. Tell me what you love. Show me how much you care about something.

The ICU was my storm cellar. As the pieces slowly broke away, and the fever grew, death was accepted. It had to be. I had to understand that it could come any day. It most people’s minds it would be soon. The fear passed, and I learned to embrace the storm; it became life, near death meant I was living. Chaos was normalcy, and death became inevitable.

Four percent of the research funding is left to create the medicine to solve one of the most difficult problems on earth, cancer.

I watched as it inched closer,  a sprinkle at first,  and a lightning storm came next.  There was something soothing about the lightning,  or maybe in hindsight it is only because of the hurricane that followed.  It transitioned with no warning, no forecast, or emergency alert.  The ICU was my storm cellar.  As the pieces slowly broke away, and the fever grew,  death was accepted.  It had to be.  I had to understand that it could come any day.  It most people’s minds it would be soon.  The fear passed, and I learned to embrace the storm;  it became life, near death meant I was living.  Chaos was normalcy, and death became inevitable.  Then I lived.  I live.  Knowing that death can come at any moment,  I’m living.
