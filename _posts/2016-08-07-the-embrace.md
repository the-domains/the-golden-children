# The Embrace

Looking through the window I saw a storm approaching.  
I watched as it inched closer,  
a sprinkle at first,  
and a lightning storm came next.  
There was something soothing about the lightning,  
or maybe in hindsight it is only because of the hurricane that followed.  
It transitioned with no warning, no forecast, or emergency alert.  
The ICU was my storm cellar.  
As the pieces slowly broke away, and the fever grew,  
death was accepted.  
It had to be.  
I had to understand that it could come any day.  
It most people's minds it would be soon.  
The fear passed, and I learned to embrace the storm;  
it became life, near death meant I was living.  
Chaos was normalcy, and death became inevitable.  
Then I lived.  
I live.  
Knowing that death can come at any moment,  
I'm living.  
There's beauty in the storms too.

Love,  
Patrick
