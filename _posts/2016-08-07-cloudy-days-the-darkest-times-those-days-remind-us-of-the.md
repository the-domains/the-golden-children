  Cloudy days; the darkest times.  Those days remind us of the storms to come. 
  The ones that arise without warning,  no signs or emergency alerts,  just the
  grey clouds.  As they inevitably arrive  we search for that speck of light, 
  that bit of sun which fought its way through.  That is our hope.  That small
  ray of sunlight,  the ray that manifests itself inside of us:  even on the
  darkest days there is something to look for.  There is always light fighting
  to be seen.
