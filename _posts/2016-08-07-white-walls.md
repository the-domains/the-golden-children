  I’m thinking about you;  behind those white walls  I can imagine your fear. 
  The unknown territory you have ventured into  and the misery you are feeling, 
  but you’re not alone.  There are so many like you,  and so many feeling
  alone.  You’re not alone, though.  I understand your pain;  I will walk you
  through it.  Your baldness is beautiful  and your scars mark your uniqueness. 
  I look at you and see hope.  I see you and I believe.  You are strength.  You
  are a warrior.

# White Walls

I'm thinking about you;  
behind those white walls  
I can imagine your fear.  
The unknown territory you have ventured into  
and the misery you are feeling,  
but you're not alone.  
There are so many like you,  
and so many feeling alone.  
You're not alone, though.  
I understand your pain;  
I will walk you through it.  
Your baldness is beautiful  
and your scars mark your uniqueness.  
I look at you and see hope.  
I see you and I believe.  
You are strength.  
You are a warrior.

Love,  
Patrick
