# Tornadoes in California

Quiet moments, the calm before the storm.  
Like clockwork the tornado comes thrashing in.  
No warnings, just the sudden memories being swept up into the whirlwind without hesitation.  
There isn't supposed to be tornadoes in California.  
Only if the quiet continues does it continue to pick up speed, so distractions are searched for like a shelter;  
an escape.  
Most times there's a hideaway near.  
But other times,  
the times when the storm seems everlasting,  
the open field goes on for miles  
with no hideaway in sight.

Love,  
Patrick
