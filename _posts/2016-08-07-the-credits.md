  Cancer;  what I had, and a part of who Iâ€™ve become.  The thing I most
  graciously loathe for what it has done  and continues to do,  you are not who
  I am.  You do not define me,  as I am a product of my fight against you.  You
  may haunt my everlasting thoughts,  you might still find a way into my dreams 
  converting them to nightmares,  but you will never find your way into my
  heart.  That is where the memories of each and every person that ever
  supported me lie,  and where the ones who gained their wings remain with me
  through each day.  That is where the credits roll,  as each name represents a
  part of the final project that is myself,  and that is where the love is
  strongest.

# The Credits

Cancer;  
what I had, and a part of who I've become.  
The thing I most graciously loathe for what it has done  
and continues to do,  
you are not who I am.  
You do not define me,  
as I am a product of my fight against you.  
You may haunt my everlasting thoughts,  
you might still find a way into my dreams  
converting them to nightmares,  
but you will never find your way into my heart.  
That is where the memories of each and every person that ever supported me lie,  
and where the ones who gained their wings remain with me through each day.  
That is where the credits roll,  
as each name represents a part of the final project that is myself,  
and that is where the love is strongest.

Love,  
Patrick
