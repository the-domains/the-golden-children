# The Survivor Dialogues: Sammy Loch

The fourth edition of The Survivor Dialogues features a very dear friend of mine from Washington, Sammy Loch. I had the opportunity to meet Sammy on a Sunshine Kids trip and have been following her journey for some time now. I am very excited for this feature, so here you go!

Patrick: Hey Sammy! I'm so glad you wanted to be apart of The Survivor Dialogues! First I just want to start off by asking what was your diagnosis and how old were you?

Sammy: I was 15 and a sophomore in high school when I was diagnosed with anaplastic medulloblastoma (a form of pediatric brain cancer) which had metastasized to my spine.

Patrick: I can't imagine how scary that must have been to have the cancer metastasize to your spine.  
Do you think being at that age had any different impact on you than if the diagnosis came at a different age?

Sammy: I feel very fortunate that I was diagnosed as a teenager. I think I handled the situation better than I could have at a younger age. I also experienced less severe side effects. My doctor told me that teenagers have worse side effects during treatment with fewer long term side effects while the opposite is true for young children. Medullo is usually diagnosed in children younger than 5\. Radiation therapy is the most effective treatment and it leaves developing children with devastating life-long physical and mental side effects.  
How do you think being diagnosed with childhood cancer as a teenager affects your experience?

Patrick: Oh wow, my cancer is usually diagnosed in older people so I kind of understand what it's like to get a cancer not typically for your age group. I've found that late effects have been prominent in most survivors I know. The mental side effects, those are the ones that effect me the most.  
What long-term effects have you noticed in yourself?

Sammy: I have a few hormones deficiencies from having full brain radiation, but the most significant long term effects I have experiences came from an infection in my leg. After my first chemo treatment I contracted a deadly flesh-eating infection in my leg called necrotizing fasciitis. I was in the hospital for six weeks and had ten operations. This infection was so unpredictable and the treatment plan kept changing. To me, this experience was much scarier than my cancer diagnosis. I know you also had a life threatening infection while you were on treatment. How do your feelings about that experience compare to your feeling about your cancer diagnosis?

Patrick: I definitely feel like the fungal infection I was diagnosed with was worse than the cancer treatment. I felt this way mostly because of the mental aspect. I had already been diagnosed with one life threatening disease, and had just found out I had another with even lower odds. Cancer had already gotten my spirits pretty far down, and for something else to come along with a survival rate less than .01%, I just didn't think it could get any worse. But then something amazing happened; I survived. All of those long days, the sleepless nights, and the seemingly endless bouts with chemo and fungal medication stopped, and I was alive.  
How did your diagnosis affect your family?

Sammy: My diagnosis had a huge impact on my family. My whole family's focus and day-to-day lives was changed because of my diagnosis. We were almost split into two families my mom and me at the hospital and my dad and brother Brandon at home.

Patrick: I'm sure that had a huge impact on your dad and brother having to be away from you guys so often. I had a similar experience, but fortunately I was the youngest and at 17, the only one still at home. My mom stayed with me 24/7 and my dad had to go back and forth from the home to work to the hospital day in and day out. Cancer definitely tested us in so many ways, but I wasn't the only one who grew stronger through my experience.  
September is a huge month for Childhood Cancer Awareness, is there anything you would want someone who doesn't know much about childhood cancer to know?

Sammy: There are two things I think people need to know about childhood cancer: Something most people don't know about cancer is that it doesn't stop after treatment. Long-term side effects both physical and psychological last a lifetime and young children who are still developing are especially prone to devastating, life-altering side effects.  
Also, adult and pediatric cancers are not the same thing and, in my opinion, research on pediatric cancer is vastly under-funded.

Patrick: Such good points, and I don't think too many people understand how difficult cancer is even after treatment has stopped. The lifelong side effects are devastating in their own right, often keeping us from feeling like a "normal" person. The funding is something that gets me every time. It is unbelievable to think people aren't as willing to give money towards research for our children, our future in this world. I am not sure if I will ever quite understand it. Thank you so much for being a part of The Survivor Dialogues! You are amazing and I can't wait to see what the future holds for you!
