# About Patrick

My name is Patrick Betters, I was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin's T-Cell Lymphoma when I was 17 years old on September 18, 2006\. Throughout treatment I've had over 5 cycles of chemo, 4 surgeries, including a lung biopsy, over 10 procedures, and two weeks of radiation. As of January 23, 2009, I've been in remission and on my way to survivorship.

Many times during treatment I felt alone, like there was nobody else out there that I could talk to that had experienced any of the feelings or thoughts I had as a teenage cancer patient. One of the hardest feelings to deal with was feeling alone; and my goal is to make sure no other childhood/teenage cancer patient ever has to feel alone again. I will raise awareness for Childhood Cancer around the world, and I will do everything I can to make sure we rid the world of this disease.

I have a documentary, Scars of Hope, which you can view here: [BApictures.com/ScarsOfHope/][0]

I am a also a motivational speaker, and open for bookings.

I have spoken or written for:  
Friends of Scott Foundation  
Sunshine Kids Foundation  
Jessie Rees Foundation  
Huffington Post  
St. Baldricks  
American Cancer Society  
High School Yearbook  
Rady's Children's Hospital  
and more.

You can email me with any questions about your own battle with cancer or to reach me for potential events here at [PatrickBetters@gmail.com][1]
