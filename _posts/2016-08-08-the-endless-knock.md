# The Endless Knock

I'm the person that falls in love with the moonlight,  
the way it changes each night depending on the moon.  
I enjoy sunsets and pictures of them. I do.  
I love going to the beach just to sit,  
and watch the waves as they never give up their endless conquest to make it onto shore;  
even though they never quite get high enough they keep going.  
I see clouds and wonder how they were formed, and hope one day I can see another one just like it.  
I prefer talking on the phone to text messaging, even if it means I can only do that one thing at a time.  
I love debates.  
Each time I get to learn something new, and get to know that person so much better.  
I don't care about the crowd or what they're doing.  
I consider myself an outsider, because that is where my passion lies.  
So, I like finding what others' are too.  
I dig, deep, I want to see a persons soul rather than flesh.  
I'm not entertained by superficial conversations.  
Give me your passion.  
Tell me what you love.  
Show me how much you care about something.  
Let me in,  
I'll stay a while.

Love,  
Patrick
