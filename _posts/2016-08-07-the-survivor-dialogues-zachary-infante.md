# **The Survivor Dialogues: Zachary Infante**

This survivor dialogues is a very special one. There has not been another one as open and as emotional as the dialogue between myself one of my best friends, Zach Infante. This has been in the works for months, but between Zach acting (movies, plays, and tv shows) and myself being in school and working full time, it has been a process. From day one, Zach and I have been close despite living on opposite coasts. He is a man I respect, and knew would take this seriously and really open up, and he did, and here it is...

**Patrick**: Zach, I am so stoked that you wanted to be a part of the Survivor Dialogues! I can talk with you forever so let's just get to it. How old were you when you were diagnosed and what was your diagnosis?

**Zach**: I was diagnosed on November 23rd 2006 with Stage IV Non- Hodgkins Lymphona. On any given occasion I like to tell myself I'm a Lymphomaniac. Our dialogue about and in support of teens with cancer is what's driven me to acknowledge, accept, and allow myself to celebrate. Moving forward the date of diagnosis is a reminder that great change is always possible. How I react and respond to my diagnosis and essentially any given circumstance in life make all the difference. Each day I remind myself that the present moment cannot pass me and the past is in the past.

**Patrick**: Lymphomanic, I'm going to have to steal that. That was almost exactly two months after my diagnosis, my Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma brother. It is so important to focus on the moment at hand, and it's taken me so long to realize that. I love what you said, though, instead of looking at our diagnosis as solely a time of horror, it is important to look at these dates as accomplishments that should be celebrated to continue to live a positive life. How did it feel to hear the words "you have cancer?"

**Zach**: The words "You... have... cancer" hits like a ton of bricks. The terror of hearing those words was irrefutable, but in time I've come to see those words so differently. Today I see "cancer" as another label or symbol for a common struggle of people across the globe. Cancer does not discriminate, no one's cancer is better or worse than anyone else's, and I am not just another statistic. Sometimes I like to think of cancer as the Statler and Waldorf from the Muppets. The two old men have box seats at the Muppets Theater and always have a quick and insulting response to everyone on stage. Now mind you, they can be playful and very loving but they always have something discourteous to say about everyone. Really, Statler and Waldorf are those thoughts in our minds that on one hand say cancer will ruin us and make us different. And on the other, remind us to celebrate life and to be honest and truthful to any muppet that comes our way. Come on, everyone's going to see struggle and no ones is better or worse than the next persons.

**Patrick**: That analogy is so perfect. The thoughts are too often what haunt me and often times they are difficult to let go of. Cancer is something that so many of us have in common, and you're right; there is no discrimination in cancer, it is just cancer. Any type of cancer can kill, and every type of cancer is horrible. One of my biggest beliefs is that life will always come with struggles, and I compare life to waves as they will always keep coming but we just have to learn to get stronger and swim through them. Cancer is a whole lot of difficult times, though. What would you say was the most difficult part about treatment?

**Zach**: I'd have to say that the fear of missing out (\#FOMO) was a huge heartbreaker. All of my friends from school could go to class, rehearsal, or whatever sweet sixteen there was to attend. In reality I was on a different path but for a long time I felt as though I was deprived of something. How could I have ever imagined that I'd make some of my greatest friends through my experiences with not-for-profit organizations bringing young survivors together? Loneliness is immortal and is part of why we create communities and symbols to unite us. When I was a fifteen year old, those gold Sunshine Kids ribbons began to symbolize another life story. The people I've encountered over the years have been proof that I haven't been deprived and I didn't miss anything.

**Patrick**: The fear of missing out was one of my biggest fears as well. It was so hard to get over that initial thought that so much was going on with my friends without me. The organizations that we have been so blessed to be a part of truly did have a huge impact on my life as well. Loneliness was definitely an easy thing to feel quite often, but it is that gold ribbon that unites so many of us, and that is something I really do love.

A lot of readers may not know, but you are quite an actor. Having been in School of Rock before diagnosis, and the diagnosis effecting your time at school and even the theater, do you think cancer had any negative impact on your acting career? And if so, how do you think it affected it?

**Zach**: Candor is essential in maintaining a healthy work relationship and surviving cancer is not something anyone needs to be pressured to keep under wraps. There have been times during a contract where long-term health complications have come up, but I do my best to communicate honestly and effectively. All in all, having cancer has made me strive to be more honest with myself and considerate of others.

**Patrick**: That makes complete sense. I feel like honesty up front will always yield better results than trying to hide something, especially like long term health complications. It's so crazy to hear, though, because I've felt like cancer has made me be more honest with myself as well and it's kind of brought me out of this shell that I used to live in. Never in my life did I ever consider public speaking, or going to events and doing news interviews, yet here I am openly speaking in front of sometimes hundreds of people at a time without even a question about "what the hell am I doing here??"

For the entire time I've known you, you have always been very outgoing and expressive of yourself, but has there ever been a time where you didn't feel like you could truly be yourself or really express yourself after the cancer diagnosis?

**Zach**: Wow, Patrick, this is tough one purely due to the way cancer has effected my self-confidence. For years before diagnosis and during treatment I felt a strong sense of pride and resilience but as I began to speak on behalf of survivors an overwhelming fear and insecurity began to set in. I fell into a depression and found that no matter how many events I did on behalf of fellow survivors I still was not good enough to have lived. I'd seen so many friends die and I had convinced myself that I was unworthy of the forum and influence that they as speakers once had in the survivor community. It wasn't until losing our friend and Sunshine Kids Spokes Kid James Ragan that I began to strap up my boots and rise above the fear and self-doubt. Like you Patrick, James had built a platform for survivors to share their experiences and I feel tied to the commitments of fellow survivors. With this inspiration I've found a truer sense of authenticity in spite of death and the feeling of inadequacy, accepting that the only truth is in the now. Presently, the resilience that I see in youth battling disease, those surviving in poverty, and the ailing elderly charges my purpose to live. Cancer sucks and I still feel sad sometimes, but I'm building a trigger process to turn my mood around while maintaining a community of friends and support to reinvigorate the self-confidence that I yet again have faith in.

**Patrick**: Survivor's guilt is something I'm all too familiar with. Seeing families that have lost a child, or children and teens who have lost siblings, and just about everybody I see that I feel like may have had a harder time than I did; they all give me this bottomless feeling of guilt. It's the opposite of the typical "Why Me?" questions you hear, I ask "why me" as a question of "why did I survive and so many others didn't?" It is something I've worked hard to get through and it has pushed me to feel an urgency to continue to help people in any capacity. Being a survivor has come with many hardships and hard feelings but after enduring so much, here we are, alive to share our stories and the stories of so many beautiful souls that will never be forgotten. We are here to help the ones yet to go through, and are currently going through it, know that they are not alone.

Now, as a survivor, what would you tell someone who was just diagnosed?

**Zach**: There's so much I always want to say but in short, I'd ask them to close their eyes and look within themselves for prime dreaming. Give trust to those who earn it, stay skeptical and allow yourself to change your own mind. Most of all, be your own friend, love your body, and write your own story.

**Patrick**: Beautifully said; change your own mind, be your own friend, love yourself, and write your own story.

It is so important to write your own story and I'm so glad you said that. Brother, I am forever grateful to have you as a huge part of my story and I still think about our first ever trip with the Sunshine Kids in 2007\. It's crazy how much we brought each other up and out of our shells as some teenagers from different parts of the United States with one common enemy and a whole lot in common. You are, and will always be considered a brother to me Zach. Thank you again for not only taking the time, but also reliving some of your hardest moments with me to help a greater cause than ourselves. I know someone will read this and get a feeling of love and family, and they will know they are not alone. Because of you, this world is better.

**Zach**: Patrick, I've appreciated your candor and persistence toward building a platform for fellow survivors to express their experiences. Thank you for introducing us to so many perspectives and for sharing your story with the world. From your film to the unending outreach, you continue to motivate and congregate our community.

To those who've read this post, thank you for your time. I encourage anyone who is fighting cancer, or struggling to find your place in the world after treatment, to work on surviving today. Dream, wish, and hope for tomorrow, but love for today. Do your homework, learn something new everyday, and give your voice a chance. Oh, and remember to brush your teeth and floss too ( :P ). If your teeth are crooked like mine, remember there's no reason to hide them! Let the sunshine on you no matter how much hair you have on your head, what color your skin is, or the way your teeth sit.

You're worth it!

Onward and upward,

Zachary Infante

**Patrick**: And just like that you have been let in to the hidden world of childhood cancer; the emotional instability mixed with an identity crisis adding to the physical effects of childhood cancer treatment. This, this Survivor Dialogues, is an invitation into the behind the scenes world of Childhood Cancer. I hope you have gained a little understanding of what this journey is, and will continue to be, during, and after cancer treatment as an adolescent fighting for their life.

Love,  
Patrick
