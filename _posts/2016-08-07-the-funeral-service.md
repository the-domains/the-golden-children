  differently.  The reality;  there was no differently,  there just wasn’t
  enough money to save their child’s life.  They were led to believe that their
  child was only worth four percent.  Four percent of the research funding is
  left to create  the medicine to solve one of the most difficult problems on
  earth,  cancer.  Meanwhile a parent lies sleepless  knowing there is no term
  for a parent who lost a child,  only the memories their child was yet to make.

# The Funeral Service

Another funeral.  
Another undersized casket gets lowered into the ground.  
The body of a child lies six feet below the surface.  
The parents, they stand above with tear filled eyes  
left to wonder if they should have done something differently.  
The reality;  
there was no differently,  
there just wasn't enough money to save their child's life.  
They were led to believe that their child was only worth four percent.  
Four percent of the research funding is left to create  
the medicine to solve one of the most difficult problems on earth,  
cancer.  
Meanwhile a parent lies sleepless  
knowing there is no term for a parent who lost a child,  
only the memories their child was yet to make.

Love,
