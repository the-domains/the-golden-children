# The Survivor Dialogues: Jon Huang

About 7 years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Jon Huang at a camp for pediatric cancer survivors and patients. Jon is now attending San Diego State University and participates in events through the hospital and other organizations around San Diego. I am so grateful that Jon was willing to participate in the third installment of The Survivor Dialogues, so here you go!

Patrick: Hey Jon, thanks for being a part of the Survivor Dialogues! I want to start by asking how old were you and what was your diagnosis?  
Jon: I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins B cell lymphoma or advance stage lymphoma stage 3 border 4 in December of 1997 at the age of 6\.   
When were you diagnosed?  
Patrick: Non-Hodgkins buddies! 6? So young. I was diagnosed 3 days after my 17th birthday with stage 3 Non-Hodgkins T-Cell Lymphoma.  
Do you have any scarring memories that have stuck with you to this day? I can't imagine the impact that must have made on your family.  
Jon: One major memory that has stuck was the moments before going into surgery to remove a tissue sample. I remember my parents crying as they held me before the nurse took me away to a room where I laid on a stretcher waiting to be administered anesthesia. The nurse allowed me to choose a smell and I choose strawberries. I remember trying to stay awake as long as I could, but knocked out after 5 seconds. From that memory the pain did not come from the surgery or the pain that came after even being drugged up, but the emotional pain that I saw in my parents face that I had caused.  
Patrick: That is one of the hardest memories that I have as well, the emotional pain I caused those around me. But, I also have very vivid memories with anesthesia. I've had at least 10 procedures that I had to be put under for due to having to go into the spine, but one in particular really sticks with me. The anesthesiologist came in and asked me if I wanted lunch. Of course I said yes, because before a procedure you can't eat for 8 hours or longer. He told me if I stayed awake he would buy me any lunch I wanted. I made that bet, and before I could tell him what I wanted for lunch I was out cold. We had a peaceful moment before I passed out, but when I woke up it was a different story. I woke up to a spiked feeling in my head, and soreness in my lower back that was so painful that I did not want to lie on my back. I had what was called a "spinal headache" and it's a rare side effect of some procedures. This was the most painful headache I had ever experienced, and not even morphine would relieve the pain.

Jon: How did your recovery go? Because I was pretty young it took me about a year to 2 years to fully be able to get back to a " normal life."

Patrick: Mentally, my recovery took a while. Sometimes I still don't think that I'm fully "recovered" from the trauma. I was able to start up the college routine as soon as I finished treatment, but I had already been going for about a year at that point so I had to adjust to being fully committed to school, but I still felt like I didn't truly get that college experience for a couple more years. I still felt like I looked different for a couple years and just didn't quite fit the college stereotype. Eventually I felt a little more a part of it, but it definitely took a couple years.  
Had you already started school when you were diagnosed?

Jon: I was on winter vacation and if I remember correctly I was in 3rd or 4th grade. I received a letter from my classmates with all their signatures hoping for me to get better. It took me about till middle school to catch up with the other students in terms of education. Before my diagnosis, I was pretty talkative, but after I was forced to mature at a really young age. I became less talkative and that definitely changed my school experience. I had a good group of friends but it was difficult for people to understand what I went through, so I just kept it to myself.  
How did you cope with leaving high school and then having to rejoin?

Patrick: It was hard because I never fully got to rejoin. I was on something called Home Hospital, which meant my teacher came to me to do my school-work. Fortunately, I had a couple teachers that I had become really close to that allowed me to still come to school and sit in what would be my normal classes, so that I could feel some sort of normalcy. This was decided as the best option for me to finish my senior year of high school. I tried coming back to school fully and I would just fall asleep in class or when trying to take my SATs I became dizzy and nauseous from sitting too long. I had a really great group of friends though, so I was still included in dances and a lot of the senior events we had all been looking forward too the past 4 years.

Jon: That's awesome that you had great friends who supported you! Have you ever experienced telling someone that you had cancer and them not believing you? (because many people cant fathom having cancer, especially at a young age) And what have you done to prove them that you did?

Patrick: Yeah, I think most people have that initial shock, and I often get the "I would have never known," comment. I have tattoos that represent my journey and I also have some pretty big scars. My proudest scar, though, is my port o' cath scar. That scar is what makes us survivors one; we have that mark. It's also where all of the chemo came through so that scar is often a big reminder to myself as well. Are there any particular chemotherapy treatments that stick in your mind?

Jon: I remember the first round very vividly. I remember the nurses brining in the yellow orange bags to be hooked up to me. I remember getting very bad tastes in my mouth and the vomiting that came after was pretty bad. I never really had a big appetite when I was little so the addition to not being able to keep food down I lost a tremendous amount of weight. I remember one night not being able to sleep because of how much hair kept falling out. The following morning I began to rip out all of my hair.

Patrick: Wow, 6 years old ripping out your own hair? I noticed my hair falling out in the shower as I was shampooing it. At that exact moment, I cried. I felt like I was beginning the end, and that meant that cancer was winning.

Jon: Do you think the first chemo was the worst or the ones that followed?

Patrick:The first definitely had the biggest impact on me, red devil, as I was told what it was like and how it would feel, and then it hit me and felt 100x worse than I could have ever imagined. The chemos to follow though, those impacted in a way I could never forget. Every dose after just made me feel as though I was withering away slowly, and each new dose added onto the last one, and I became weaker and weaker. That will be something I will remember forever.  
Being that it is Childhood Cancer Awareness month, what is one thing you would want everyone reading this to know about Childhood Cancer?

Jon: The real struggle continues after cancer, so the support must continue.

Patrick: You're right about that. Too many people think it ends as soon as you hit remission, and for me it felt like that was only the beginning.

Jon: I agree. I suffered depression and being lost at life, like not knowing what to do, why I'm here, why I was chosen.

Patrick: That is the most interesting thing to me. For so long I questioned why I had survived and other kids hadn't. Or why I was given the opportunity to do so many of the things I've been able to accomplish and participate in, but then I stopped questioning it. I started focusing on the fact that I now could tell their stories to impact other children's lives, and I could help assure that their legacy continues. So instead of questioning I just started to do something about it, and I haven't stopped since.

Jon: I think it took me about 10 years to fully accept it. I get lost at times but with time and great family and friends helps tremendously. I'm glad you are doing what you do especially for the children unable who are unable to speak anymore. I would love to do what your doing and spread awareness through talks but I'm more shy. That's why I was so happy when you asked me to participate in this dialoged because it's something I am capable of doing and could enlighten many people about childhood cancer.

Patrick: Well I am so glad you wanted to participate, and I know it is easy to get lost sometimes but we have to remember how far we have come. In life there will always be challenges, but the hardest challenges are the ones we place on ourselves. I am proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone to be a part of this project and thank you again. Just by being a part of this you are making a difference in the lives of others.

Love,  
Patrick
