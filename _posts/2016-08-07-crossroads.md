  full of destruction and pain. It is not the easy road, but it tests you it
  helps you find your true self. So, you go, and you make a choice

# **Crossroads**

There you go  
aimlessly down a one way street,  
the same street everyday, blindly following the habitual path.  
Until one day you hit a detour at a crossroad,  
a road you've never seen; good or bad it is an adventure.  
You have no [choice][0] but to take it.  
And you go.  
It takes you down a road you never thought you'd see,  
and [maybe][1] it's painful;  
maybe it's painful, heartbreaking, terrifying, exhilarating, life changing, inspirational, deadly, and uplifting all at the same time.  
Once you go down that road, there's no way back.  
This road has become a part of you now,  
it creates who you are.  
And you have a choice.  
You choose whether to [create][2] something wonderful, or create a road full of destruction and pain.  
It is not [the easy road][3], but it tests you  
it helps you find your true self.  
So, you go,  
and you make a choice

Love,  
Patrick
