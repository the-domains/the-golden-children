  Here I am  speaking on runaway trains;  letting you see the view but not too
  close,  only through the windows.  You get a beautiful picture,  but the story
  behind it remains unknown.  The magnificent views are breathtaking,  yet they
  are nothing compared to their creation.  One day the story will contain more
  than the headlines,  but for now the tracks continue and the views keep
  running.

# The Runaway Train

Here I am  
speaking on runaway trains;  
letting you see the view but not too close,  
only through the windows.  
You get a beautiful picture,  
but the story behind it remains unknown.  
The magnificent views are breathtaking,  
yet they are nothing compared to their creation.  
One day the story will contain more than the headlines,  
but for now the tracks continue and the views keep running.

Love,  
Patrick
