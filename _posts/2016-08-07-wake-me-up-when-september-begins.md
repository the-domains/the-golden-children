  September is coming up really quickly and for those of you that don’t know,
  September is a huge month for Childhood Cancer, as well as myself. September
  is the official “Childhood CancerAwareness Month,” although, I believe
  awareness should beimportant all year. It also happens to be the month that I
  was diagnosed with cancer almost 9 years ago. This year, September 18th, 2015
  will mark 9 years since the day I was diagnosed with cancer and my life
  completely changed forever. Growing up, not once did I ever even consider that
  cancer could make a directimpact on my life. Like many people, I thought
  cancer only affected older people, as in it was one of the diseases you get at
  an old age and often times lead to death. I lost my grandpa to cancer when I
  was in elementary school, and I assumed it was part of life. Never in a
  million years did I ever think I would see all of thechildren and babies that
  I saw in the hospital after I was diagnosed. I saw children not even a year
  old, children that had never even seen a park yet, teenagers who hadn’t yet
  been to a dance, and the list goes on and on. After being diagnosed,
  thethoughts of all of the life experiences I might not ever get began to cross
  my mind rapidly. It wasn’t just for myself, though, it was of all the things I
  witnessed inside the hospital. Children had I.V. pole tricycles, they had only
  a couple hours a day to go into the play room, and the teenagers didn’t have
  much of anything. It saddened me to see how much deeper a cancer
  diagnosisimpacted people than anyone might stop to think. It isn’t just about
  the chemo, the hair loss, and the drastic change in health, but also about the
  emotional and developmental impact it makes as well. Some kids lost their
  battles before ever having the chance to make a friend; think about that for a
  second. All of the life events that we think are normal, or we expect to
  happen, these are the things that so many of kids/teens affected by cancer
  never get a chance to experience. It’s unfathomable.

# **Wake Me Up When September Begins**

[September][0] is coming up really quickly and for those of you that don't know, September is a huge [month][1] for [Childhood][2][Cancer][3], as well as myself. September is the official "[Childhood Cancer][4][Awareness][5] Month," although, I [believe][6] awareness should be[important][7] all year. It also happens to be the month that I was diagnosed with cancer almost 9 years ago. This year, [September 18th][8], 2015 will mark 9 years since the day I was diagnosed with cancer and my life completely changed forever. Growing up, not once did I ever even [consider][9] that cancer could make a direct[impact][10] on my life. Like many [people][11], I thought cancer only affected older people, as in it was one of the diseases you get at an old age and often times lead to [death][12]. I lost my grandpa to cancer when I was in elementary [school][13], and I assumed it was part of life. Never in a million years did I ever think I would see all of the[children][14] and babies that I saw in the [hospital][15] after I was diagnosed. I saw children not even a year old, children that had never even seen a park yet, [teenagers][16] who hadn't yet been to a dance, and the list goes on and on. After being diagnosed, the[thoughts][17] of all of the life experiences I might not ever get began to cross my mind rapidly. It wasn't just for myself, though, it was of all the things I witnessed inside the hospital. Children had I.V. pole tricycles, they had only a couple hours a day to go into the play room, and the teenagers didn't have much of anything. It saddened me to see how much deeper a cancer [diagnosis][18]impacted people than anyone might stop to think. It isn't just about the [chemo][19], the hair loss, and the drastic [change][20] in [health][21], but also about the emotional and developmental impact it makes as well. Some kids lost their [battles][22] before ever having the chance to make a friend; think about that for a second. All of the life events that we think are normal, or we expect to happen, these are the things that so many of kids/[teens][23] affected by cancer never get a chance to experience. It's unfathomable.

This brings me to the very recent buzz that childhood cancer has picked up. Childhood Cancer has picked up full steam going into September and I couldn't be happier. Many of you know, and if you haven't you can google it, but Taylor Swift performed a song "[Ronan][24]" for the second time ever this past week and it took the[world][25] by storm. Childhood Cancer is in the mainstream media! That's right, they're focusing on something positive for a change![Mama Maya][26], Ronan's mom, lost her son a couple years ago due to a Neuroblastoma diagnosis and she hasn't strayed away from fighting cancer head on. She's gone with her [emotions][27] and dedicated her life to fighting cancer, and it has impacted awareness, and [celebrity][28] support in a huge way. Now that we are booming in full speed going into September, a month where I also celebrate an [anniversary][29], I want your support. I want you guys to share this, share a picture and tag me in it, anything, but share something that includes something gold that you will wear or share with somebody else in honor of myself and so many children that have survived, passed away, and are currently fighting this[disease][30]. During the month of September, I want you to wear something gold, even if it is something like makeup, or something silly, wear something gold, and share it with me and all of your followers/[friends][31], and I will share it as well. I want Childhood Cancer to be trending as much as possible throughout the month of September and I cannot do that without your help. Who's with me?? I know I have some amazing supporters, and I cannot stress enough how much I need each and every one of you. Please wear gold at least once during the month of September and let me see it when you do!

Love,  
Patrick
