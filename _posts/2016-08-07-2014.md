  Some days I want to sit and sulk. I want to feel sad and think unrationally
  for an entire night, wasting time while I could be sleeping peacefully. But I
  can’t, because I feel guilty for being sad, and I know it sounds dumb, or
  crazy, but I do. I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad, and they would
  tell me everything is going to be okay, and the truth is I know it will too.
  But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to just let the sadness take me over and
  pour it all out sometimes. In all reality, I’ve known way too many children
  that have died to be okay. I’m twenty five years old and I can’t even count
  the number of children and friends I’ve known that have died on my fingers and
  toes. It sucks. And thinking about it makes me sick to m stomach, and it makes
  me want to break down and want to curl up in a ball and sulk. But I can’t. I
  can’t, because that doesn’t help anybody. That would get nothing accomplished
  and would benefit nobody but myself, which is why I’d feel guilty, and that’s
  even worse than feeling sad. I wish I could just pick up a phone an call you.
  Each and every one of you, and I can’t do that either, and that sucks too. And
  I even feel guilty for this rant, and I know I shouldn’t because this rant is
  spreading awareness too, but I do. But that’s life, and that’s the beauty of
  it. I feel, therefore I am alive. And that is a beautiful thing, and it’s
  something to be celebrated. Life should be a celebration, so here is to you
  and your loved ones. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Some days I want to sit and sulk. I want to feel sad and think unrationally for an entire night, wasting time while I could be sleeping peacefully. But I can't, because I feel guilty for being sad, and I know it sounds dumb, or crazy, but I do. I know that they wouldn't want me to be sad, and they would tell me everything is going to be okay, and the truth is I know it will too. But that doesn't mean I don't want to just let the sadness take me over and pour it all out sometimes. In all reality, I've known way too many children that have died to be okay. I'm twenty five years old and I can't even count the number of children and friends I've known that have died on my fingers and toes. It sucks. And thinking about it makes me sick to m stomach, and it makes me want to break down and want to curl up in a ball and sulk. But I can't. I can't, because that doesn't help anybody. That would get nothing accomplished and would benefit nobody but myself, which is why I'd feel guilty, and that's even worse than feeling sad. I wish I could just pick up a phone an call you. Each and every one of you, and I can't do that either, and that sucks too. And I even feel guilty for this rant, and I know I shouldn't because this rant is spreading awareness too, but I do. But that's life, and that's the beauty of it. I feel, therefore I am alive. And that is a beautiful thing, and it's something to be celebrated. Life should be a celebration, so here is to you and your loved ones. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
