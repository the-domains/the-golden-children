  Two of my favorite things in existence, the sun and the moon.  Without one,

  where it single handedly changes the color of the sky,  demanding to be seen
  before it disappears for a while.

# Illuminating Darkness

Two of my favorite things in existence, the sun and the moon.  
Without one, you cannot have days, and without the other, you cannot have nights.  
They work hand in hand throughout our lives,  
though it is what they do individually that amazes me.  
The sun shines bright day in and day out,  
but as it falls it shows us its power truly comes at its lowest point;  
the point where it single handedly changes the color of the sky,  
demanding to be seen before it disappears for a while.

Then, there's the moon.  
The moon has the power to brighten the moments when the sun hides away;  
creating a light for the darkest moments.  
And as the sun rises once again, the moon falls,  
as if to say it was only there because the sun was in need.  
Until another day ends.

Always remember, you, one person, can be the light during someones darkest days.

Love,  
Patrick
