# Because I Knew You

I've overcome everything I've undergone,  
and I somehow found a way to pave the path that I've been on.  
My story became your story, and now it's ours  
to share with the world so that you may never be unknown.  
Adversity struck, and here we are  
7 years later  
and I'm still trying o figure out what the hell happened.  
Sometime tells me I'll never know,  
but I knew you  
and that's all that matters.

Love,  
Patrick
