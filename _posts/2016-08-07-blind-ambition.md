# **Blind Ambition**

I believe in things I am yet to see.

Strength;  
my definition may differ from yours,  
as the strength I've experienced is immeasurable to a scale.

Love;  
aside from acts of it, it is not seen by the eyes, rather felt by the heart.  
Yet, I see it everywhere.  
In you, and in this world where we live.

Faith;  
you cannot measure it, but it's there,  
in myself, in you, and in the ones I know look out for me each and every day.  
See, seeing is not believing.  
for seeing is only a perception of what we want to believe.  
So, I choose to believe in the things I cannot see  
because those are the things you cannot lose.

Love,  
**Patrick**
