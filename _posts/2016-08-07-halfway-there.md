  You win and you lose.  You pass and you fail.  You’re right and you’re wrong. 
  You love and you hate.  You’re happy and you’re sad;  Each no better than the
  other.  With the best comes the worst,  and the brightest days bring the
  darkest nights.  The higher the mountain, the steeper the slope;  the most
  highs bring the deepest lows.  Either way, you’re halfway there.  There will
  always be ups, and with ups come downs.  One only available with the other
  like a package deal.  The best roller coasters have the scariest drops,  the
  ride is what you’re really there for.  So no matter where you are in life, 
  you’re halfway there.

# Halfway There

You win and you lose.  
You pass and you fail.  
You're right and you're wrong.  
You love and you hate.  
You're happy and you're sad;  
Each no better than the other.  
With the best comes the worst,  
and the brightest days bring the darkest nights.  
The higher the mountain, the steeper the slope;  
the most highs bring the deepest lows.  
Either way, you're halfway there.  
There will always be ups, and with ups come downs.  
One only available with the other like a package deal.  
The best roller coasters have the scariest drops,  
the ride is what you're really there for.  
So no matter where you are in life,  
you're halfway there.

Love,  
Patrick
