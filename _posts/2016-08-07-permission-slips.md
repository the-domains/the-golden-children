# **Permission Slips**

There is no [choice][0];  
no signature required or permission slip needed.  
The [fight][1] just starts.  
You don't get a warning or a signal,  
just those devastating [words][2],  
and it begins.  
Pain is constant.  
Heartbreak always lies near  
with the fear of impending news.  
So, you wait.  
The [medicine][3] runs and the [feelings][4] are unbearable,  
but time does not stop and the days keep coming.  
And you hope,  
you hope that on one of those days you'll find out the fight is over.  
You pray that it is because you've won,  
for the contrary brings shattered [dreams][5].  
The fight is over, but it never really

Love,  
Patrick
