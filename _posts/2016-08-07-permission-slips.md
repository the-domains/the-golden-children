  There is no choice;  no signature required or permission slip needed.  The
  fight just starts.  You don’t get a warning or a signal,  just those
  devastating words,  and it begins.  Pain is constant.  Heartbreak always lies
  near  with the fear of impending news.  So, you wait.  The medicine runs and
  the feelings are unbearable,  but time does not stop and the days keep

  fight is over.  You pray that it is because you’ve won,  for the contrary
  brings shattered dreams.  The fight is over, but it never really

# **Permission Slips**

There is no choice;  
no signature required or permission slip needed.  
The fight just starts.  
You don't get a warning or a signal,  
just those devastating words,  
and it begins.  
Pain is constant.  
Heartbreak always lies near  
with the fear of impending news.  
So, you wait.  
The medicine runs and the feelings are unbearable,  
but time does not stop and the days keep coming.  
And you hope,  
you hope that on one of those days you'll find out the fight is over.  
You pray that it is because you've won,  
for the contrary brings shattered dreams.  
The fight is over, but it never really

Love,  
Patrick
