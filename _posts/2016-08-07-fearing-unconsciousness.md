  Have you ever been scared to go to sleep?  I mean terrified to the point where
  you fight it until you’re unconscious and don’t remember falling asleep. 
  Where you’re so scared of not waking up in the morning that you stay up until
  ridiculous hours of the night trying to find the single thought floating
  around your mind that says “it’s going to be okay?”  And you search all night
  for that thought, and even then you are unconscious before you ever find it. 
  But then something crazy happens;  You wake up.  And you touch everything
  around you to make sure it’s real,  and it is.  You’re alive, and you’re here
  to see another day.  That,  that right there is something to be grateful for.

# Fearing Unconsciousness

Have you ever been scared to go to sleep?  
I mean terrified to the point where you fight it until you're unconscious and don't remember falling asleep.  
Where you're so scared of not waking up in the morning that you stay up until ridiculous hours of the night trying to find the single thought floating around your mind that says "it's going to be okay?"  
And you search all night for that thought, and even then you are unconscious before you ever find it.  
But then something crazy happens;  
You wake up.  
And you touch everything around you to make sure it's real,  
and it is.  
You're alive, and you're here to see another day.  
That,  
that right there is something to be grateful for.

Love,  
Patrick
