  Grab my hand, I’ll take you where you need to go.  A place where pain doesn’t

  Changed was the world, as well as the man.

# Pandora

Grab my hand, I'll take you where you need to go.  
A place where pain doesn't exist,  
yet we still learn to experience true happiness.  
Somewhere where all of the good times are truly appreciated.  
Do you trust me? Would you follow me there?  
See, here cancer doesn't exist, it lies only in history.  
Found only in the books, but our minds have moved on.  
Here, love is talked about, and it is spread every day,  
and that is because of one person;  
someone who had had enough with all of the negativity  
so he decided to do something about it.  
Changed was the world, as well as the man.

Love,  
Patrick
