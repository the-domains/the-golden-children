# Hurricanes and Runaway Trains

Don't be sad if I don't stay long.  
I never do.  
I'm here to help you feel like someone understands,  
I guess it's my way of dealing with a lack of being understood.  
I'm used to it, though.  
I spend most of my time with my racing thoughts.  
So, forgive me for always being on the move,  
my mind doesn't seem to enjoy being passive;  
aggressive is its nature.  
Lonely are the storms as they come and go as fast,  
remembered only by the impact they had on the lives they changed.  
Metaphors of a survivor dropped in the real world.

Love,  
Patrick
